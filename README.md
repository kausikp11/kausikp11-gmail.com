SWCR
Seashore Waste Cleaning Robot(SWCR) is a robot which can clean the seashore. This robot is made in keep cost as a huge factor in mind. The SWCR can work autonomously in cleaning the seashore using Arduino and Raspberry Pi. Now I have made the URDF completely working. For future I will upload the coding details and merge it with ROS.
